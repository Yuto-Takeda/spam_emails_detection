# Spam Emails Detection

## Overview

This is the personal project to determine the spam emails. I used the email data set in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) to build the model the predict whether or not the emails is spam. First, I perform TF-IDF, which is technique in NLP to converting the words into vectors and generate the features. Then, I build the Random Forest to classify the emails whether or not they are spam. The result of the model is following.


F1 score :  0.904

Recall score :  0.848

Precision score :  0.969
